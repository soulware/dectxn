=== v0.3.x

[tbc]

=== v0.2.1

Txn::requires_new implementation - raises exception if inside existing active transaction.
This is currently inconsistent with the Java world (JEE and Spring) but provides basic functionality.
Ideally this would start a new transaction for the duration of the method call 
but Rails maintains a single transaction per thread.

=== v0.1.1

Initial release. 
Txn::required implemented.
