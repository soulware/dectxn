== dectxn - Rails Declarative Transactions

dectxn is a Ruby on Rails plugin that provides declarative transaction management.

=== Installation
	
script/plugin install git://github.com/soulware/dectxn.git

The plugin will create <tt>config/initializers/dectxn_config.rb</tt>.
This is where your transactions can be configured.

dectxn uses the aquarium (http://aquarium.rubyforge.org) AOP framework.
	sudo gem install aquarium

=== Example

The following line declares that calls to all "my_xxx" methods in Account will be wrapped with required (join existing or begin new) transaction semantics.

	Txn::required :for_type => Account, :calls_to => /^my_/

=== Further Info

The following transactional options are currently supported - 
* Txn::required
* Txn::requires_new
